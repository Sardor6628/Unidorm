Development of a University Dormitory Management System 

What is UniDorm?

UniDorm – an application that uses a database and helps students and people in charge of dormitory management to keep in touch.

Why do we need it?

Current research shows that, foreign students who live in dormitory have some difficulties to contact the university, they have to go to the International exchange office or Student Support Center just to talk about their problems. On the other hand, if the management office wants to say something to students, people in charge need to contact via email and it is the only connection way.

What can I do with it?

Communicate with Management Office
Chat with other residence of the dormitory
Can access university web-site
Can see public announcements
